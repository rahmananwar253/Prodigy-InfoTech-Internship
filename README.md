# 🚀 My Internship at Prodigy Infotech

Welcome to my **internship journey** with **Prodigy Infotech**, where I spent a meaningful time diving deep into the world of **data analysis**, **data visualization**, and **machine learning**. This repository reflects the culmination of my efforts and learning across various exciting tasks. I’ve had the privilege to work on real-world data problems that challenged me to grow both technically and professionally. ✨

## 💡 About This Internship

During my internship, I completed **5 key tasks** that allowed me to develop hands-on experience in the following areas:
- **Data Analysis:** Extracting insights from data to guide decision-making.
- **Data Visualization:** Telling stories with data using powerful visuals.
- **Machine Learning Models:** Developing predictive models and fine-tuning them for accuracy.

## 🎯 What This Repository Includes:

This repository contains all my internship work files, notebooks, and resources. Here’s a quick rundown of the tasks I completed:

### Task 1: **Data Preprocessing & Exploration**
- Cleaned messy datasets and performed data wrangling.
- Conducted exploratory data analysis (EDA) to uncover hidden patterns.

### Task 2: **Data Visualization**
- Created interactive and static visualizations using **matplotlib**, **seaborn**, and **plotly**.
- Turned raw data into visually engaging insights.

### Task 3: **Supervised Learning Models**
- Implemented various machine learning models like **Linear Regression**, **Decision Trees**, and **Random Forests**.
- Evaluated the models using metrics like accuracy, precision, and recall.

### Task 4: **Unsupervised Learning & Clustering**
- Worked on clustering algorithms such as **K-Means** and **DBSCAN**.
- Applied dimensionality reduction techniques like **PCA** to improve model performance.

### Task 5: **Sentiment Analysis**
- Analyzed and visualized sentiment patterns from social media data.
- Used NLP techniques to process text data and train classifiers.

## 🔧 Tech Stack & Tools
I had the opportunity to work with some powerful tools and technologies during my internship, including:
- **Python** 🐍 (Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, NLTK, etc.)
- **Jupyter Notebooks** 📓
- **Matplotlib & Seaborn** for Data Visualization 📊
- **Git & GitHub** for version control 🗂️
- **Machine Learning Algorithms** 🤖
- **Natural Language Processing (NLP)** techniques for text-based analysis 📝

## 📈 Key Takeaways

This internship was more than just completing tasks—it was about growing, learning, and pushing the boundaries of my abilities:
- I learned how to transform data into actionable insights.
- I enhanced my problem-solving skills and coding practices.
